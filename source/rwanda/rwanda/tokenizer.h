// Parameters:

// result = the tokens for str
// delimiters = the delimiter t_characters
// delimiters preserve = same as above, but the delimiter t_characters
//		will be put into the result as a token
// quote = t_characters to protect the enclosed t_characters
// esc = t_characters to protect a single t_character
